## About Me

I'm a highly motivated QA engineer with a strong focus on **automated testing**, **tool building**, and **process improvement**. I transitioned into tech with a deep curiosity about how software works — and more importantly, how it breaks.

I specialize in using tools like **Playwright**, **Selenium**, and **Pytest** to ensure the highest product quality. I enjoy writing clean, scalable test scripts and continuously improving my skills with real-world projects.
